			You have already made goggles which allow you to see the auras and nodes permeating the world, but there is a problem. Not only do those goggles provide little protection, but they are flimsy and can rather easily be destroyed when you get hurt. Knowing that you also have access to an unbreakable helmet made of bedrock, the hardest material known, you hit upon the idea of combining the two. The bedrock is tough and cannot be reshaped except in a Blast Furnace, a machine which does not support any sort of magical interaction, so you will be forced to infuse the magic powers of the thaumometers into the helmet through another means, perhaps binding it with quicksilver and salis mundus.

			Heavy weaponry is only useful insofar as the entity you wish to kill is vulnerable to the damage you inflict. And, much to your horror, that evil black distortion is all but immune to mundane sorts of harm. However, the creeping insanity it has inflicted on you has come with a hidden blessing; you have now realized how to create an unholy alloy of evil and metal, and can probably turn that on the monster. As the saying goes, 'fight fire with fire', only here the fire is crystallized insanity and rage, the other fire is a warping of reality itself, and the analogy is...breaking down almost as rapidly as your mind has done in the presence of that thing.
